<strong>Soft skills</strong><br/>
I think the high requirements for ourself and great teamwork with other colleagues are the
soft conditions that employees must-have. Correct use of words, intonation and body
language is the most important to communicate effectively with others.First of all, I will be
strict with myself in my study and work, for example, I will make a reasonable schedule to
plan my work and study to ensure that all tasks are completed on time. I think this is also very
important in group cooperation, which will help us arrange the work of each team member
reasonably. Secondly, in teamwork, I will promote cooperation between teams through
efficient and scientific methods, such as distinguishing the strengths and weaknesses between
members, grouping members to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, to
achieve the highest work efficiency. Besides, I think I am good at listening to other people's
ideas with my own opinions. During university, I participated in group activities many times
and have rich experience.

<strong>Analytic skills</strong><br/>
Yelp is looking for individuals who are proficient in data analysis and R and python, after
three years of university statistics courses, I have mastered the use of R proficiently and
completed many projects on my own, for example, exploring COVID-19 data for Toronto,
Canada. After class, I often join the research team to cooperate with my classmates to
complete some statistical data analysis work. During the study, I can skillfully use ggplot in R
to build models and visualize data. In addition, I learned Python and other computer
languages as a draft pick in my freshman year, which will be of great help to my work.

<strong>Connection to studies</strong><br/>
In this semester's 303 course, I will complete the production of a profile website. I will show
my data analysis and some of my personal experience so far on my profile website. This
profile website will more vividly show you my ability in using R and python, which will be
very helpful when I apply for a job. Secondly, this website will better show my peers what I
am good at and what I am lack, which will help us save time and avoid unnecessary conflicts
in future teamwork. In addition, I need to keep learning to make up for my shortcomings. I
plan to study SQL this semester, which has a special emphasis on recruitment information. I
also try to complete several cases independently and get a certificate, which will increase my
competitiveness.
