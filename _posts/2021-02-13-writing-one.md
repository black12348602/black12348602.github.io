What is Statistics and what can statisticians do? I believe that different ages of me
will have different answers. The study of some statistical courses at the University helped me
preliminary grasp what statistics does. At the same time, my understanding of this subject has
changed a lot.

Before entering university, I learned a few basic statistics concepts through the data
class in high school. At that time, I thought that the main content of statisticians needed to do
was to calculate the specific data value and make some graphs like box plot and dot plot.
During that time I thought the data we get in statistics are unique and certainly, since we
already know all the data values, it's not difficult to calculate the mean and other values. The
studies in high school made me have a great interest in data and I decided to continue to study
statistics in university.

However, after three years of statistical learning in the university, I have a different
understanding of statistics. I started to come into contact with various statistical models rather
than just calculate the basic variables, which made me realize that the models we made now
can only reflect the overall situation of the population. Since the size of the model is huge, we
cannot take care of every event in the population accurately. However, there is a common
aphorism in statistics, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." At university, I realized
that statistics is the subject to infer the essence of the object and predict the future trend of the
object by organizing, analyze and calculate the data, what we should do about statistics is to
choose the sample size to reflect the overall situation and then use some useful tests such as
ANOVA to check whether the overall assumptions of these samples are statistically valid.

People of different ages will have different views on things due to their level of
knowledge, in the past, I thought statistics was just a mathematical subject to calculating data,
but now I know that the more important content in statistics is to sort out, analyze and predict
the data value, which is what statisticians do. Therefore, we need to improve ourselves
through continuous learning. In the future, I believe that I will have a more accurate view and
understanding of the subject of statistics through my study.
